From David Keyes of [R for the Rest of Us](https://rfortherestofus.com):

> In this episode, I talk with Silvia Canelón, a postdoctoral research scientist in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania. Silvia shares why she loves using xaringan to create captivating, audience-friendly presentations directly from R markdown. Making presentations with R Markdown not only saves her time, but also eases the stress associated with updating and distributing presentations.
